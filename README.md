   ### *"I'm sorry for doing my job"*
    
* Drank the blood of some people but it turned out they were on drugs so now he's a wizard
* Totally an American citizen who passed that test for sure
* Like sparkles
* Also like creepy paper
* Guillermo is not invited
* Not a fan of werewolves
* Not a fan of witches either
* Has a living descendant on Staten Island
